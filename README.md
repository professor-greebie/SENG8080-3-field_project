# Genome Visualization Project: Cancer Therapy and Clonal Hematopoiesis	
## Introduction 
In this project, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of cancer therapy and clonal hematopoiesis by leveraging data from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) study, published in Nature Genetics in 2020.

### Project Scope and Objectives
Our primary goal is to analyze and visually represent the intricate genetic landscape associated with cancer therapy and clonal hematopoiesis. By delving into extensive research, data collection, preprocessing, and analysis, we aim to uncover underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. This project culminates in the creation of an interactive dashboard that translates complex genomic data into actionable insights.

### Data Source

The cornerstone of our endeavor is the MSK study titled "Cancer Therapy and Clonal Hematopoiesis." This study provides a rich dataset that offers profound insights into the genetic alterations accompanying cancer therapy and their implications for patients. Through our Genome Visualization Project, we strive to bridge the gap between intricate genomics data and its practical applications in the realm of cancer treatment and clonal hematopoiesis.

### Project Significance

Our ultimate aspiration is to facilitate the interpretation of genomic data, unearth novel discoveries, and potentially revolutionize personalized treatment strategies for individuals battling cancer. By employing visualization techniques, we aim to present a clearer picture of the complex genetic interactions involved, ultimately contributing to advancements in cancer therapy and patient care.

Stay tuned as we navigate through the different phases of our project, from data exploration to visualization, and unlock new insights into the intricate world of cancer therapy and clonal hematopoiesis.
